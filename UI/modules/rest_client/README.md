The purpose the Kohana REST Client project is to provide a simple way to work
with remote REST services from the Kohana PHP web framework.

This project is currently being developed against:

This project aims to closely follow the same general spirit of the Kohana
framework itself as regards code organization, in-line documentation, and code
formatting. To this end, suggestions are welcome.
