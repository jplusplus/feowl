Feowl will provide the citizens, journalists and businesses of Douala, Cameroon, with reliable data about the electricity supply. Local media will leverage a network of SMS-enabled contributors, whom the Feowl platform will automatically poll at regular intervals.

Feowl is financed by the International Press Institute's News Contest.
If you are a developer, a designer, a statistician, an electricity specialist, a venture capitalist or an owl breeder and want to help us make Feowl fly, drop us a line at contact@feowl.com
